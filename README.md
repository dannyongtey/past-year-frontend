#   Past Year Scrapper Front End

The front end repo for the scrapper backend.

## Status

Alpha. Fully working as of now. Tweaks needed here and there.

### Known bug list

- Environment variables not loaded

## Tech Stack

ReactJS, React-Redux, Axios, Google Auth

## Setup

Pull the thing. Then,

`npm install` and `npm start`

## Features

- Simplicity: No junk UI
- Performance: No useless plugins and files to load. What you see is what is loaded.
- PWA: I'm too lazy to push this to App store and Play store. Hence, just visit the site and add it to your homescreen.

## I Want to Contribute

Pull requests are accepted at the moment. 

I purposely kept the design at a minimum so someone else who is interested can make a better design.
